This program implements a key-stroke training game. In which, the user 
continuously attempts to remove characters from the screen as they fly by. 
Each key-stroke of a character corresponding to one on the screen, 
will remove that character. If any character succesfully moves all the way 
across the screen, the game is over. 

To compile and run, in a directory with all the java files:

> javac Main.java
> java Main

Enjoy!
